developer-instagram-feed v 0.0.4
================

REQUIRES PHP 5.3+

Allows developers to easily connect to the Instagram API and provides functions for retrieving a user's photos. It only returns an array so developers can style the feed as they wish.

Tired of opinionated plug-ins that do too much styling of content from the Instagram API? Tired of having to get user credentials to authorize the Instagram API for your clients? Tired of plugins that only allow one Instagram user's feed?

That's why we built this one. You set up an Instagram API Client for your WordPress installation and then your user's can authenticate the API Client when editing their user profile. All you need to do is send a user ID to a function and you can pull in that user's latest Instagrams.
